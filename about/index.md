title: What is LocalGov Digital?
---

LocalGov Digital is the network for digital practitioners in local government. Our aim is to aid the delivery of better, cheaper local services by councils across the country, through the re-design of services around the capabilities the internet and digital technology provide.

Our belief is that an overarching and fundamental principle is that local government is and should be ‘open by default and digital by design’ and that we think, do and share. The network was founded in 2012 and has grown to involve thousands of local government practitioners. Find out more about becoming a member of the network.
