LocalGovCamp Fringe Friday 2014 was part of [LocalGovCamp 2014](https://localgov.digital/events/localgovcamp/lgc2014). It featured two events:

## LocalGov Makers Day

LocalGov Makers, partnered by Nesta, ran a hack day with the aim to collaborate and prototype solutions to some of the challenges facing citizens and local government.

Organisations opened their APIs to help attendees to create their prototypes - these includes NHS Choices, Ordnance Survey and the Environment Agency.

The event wasn't only for coders and developers but for service managers, content designers and frontliners too. There was plenty of user needs and user experience done on the day to create the requirements for the prototypes.

## FutureGov Leaders' Summit

The Leaders' Summit, partnered by CapacityGRID and FutureGov, brought together senior officers and politicians to hear from digital leaders in the sector and workshop service design techniques.
