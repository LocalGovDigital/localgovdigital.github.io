LocalGovCamp 2014 was the first organised by LocalGov Digital; it was also the first time LocalGovCamp had been held over two days.

The hashtag for the event was #localgovcamp and you can [see blog posts and pictures of the day here.](https://localgov.digital/events/localgovcamp/lgc2014/localgovcamp-2014-blogs-pics)

## Main Unconference - Saturday 21 June 2014

The LocalGovCamp unconference is a participant-led event where the agenda is crowd-sourced on the day. Delegates then gather around the topics suggested in informal sessions intended to encourage conversation and collaborative working.

In 2014 there were more than 28 sessions available for attendees to choose from including agile working in local government, practical user experience techniques, open data, collaborative working across sectors, a range of sessions on council websites and encouraging digital democracy. ![the session grid at localgovcamp 2014](images/10457452_10152205926813553_6965276624554073874_o-300x199.jpg) Around 170 people came together including officers and councillors from all tiers of local government, central government, public sector, voluntary sector, freelancers and private sector and individuals passionate about public services.
