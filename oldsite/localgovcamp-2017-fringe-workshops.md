**1\. Culture still eats Strategy .......(40 mins)**

Even in the Digital world the challenges and issues are the same. We'll use this workshop to show you how you can get colleagues engaged in the digital journey by providing an art of the possible spark.

**2\. It's not about Digital it's about Transformation (40 mins)**

The issue most LA's are facing is keeping up with the way the rest of the world is changing. We'll discuss how use of modern tools can lead to the transformation and tick all the digital engagement boxes

**3\. Putting the Citizen at the centre of the new Digital Authority (40 mins)**

Far too many Authorities are missing the trick around engaging with citizens. Providing the wrong kind of silo engagement channels increases the burden on the front and the back end. We'll discuss a strategy for improving the circular customer service journey.

**4\. How to achieve Digital Transformation in a Scalable, Affordable way (40mins)**

**10\. GOVbuntu – An Open Source Operating System for Public Services (40 mins)**

This technically-focused workshop highlights the work of NHSbuntu, the open source initiative that makes software to fit the NHS, not expecting the NHS to fit the software. In building NHSbuntu, an open source operating system for the NHS, the team's next question is: who's building GOVbuntu?

**11\. Getting the Most of Data.Gov.Uk (40 mins)**

**13\. Designing Public Services Around Data with the ODI (40 mins)**

How should we design public services to be enabled by data? What models have been used successfully elsewhere and how do we put them into practice? In this session, the Open Data Institute will tackle these questions and invite participants to apply the responses to their own service problems.

**14\. Standardisation in Local Services: Planning and Beyond (40 mins)**

Participants will learn about the value of standardisation and open standards in local services and processes with a deep dive into the Brownfield Land Register, which will be mandated by Department for Communities and Local Government from December 2017 onwards.

The session will also give an overview of the 'city' standards currently out there that are equally relevant to all councils, and discuss how standards provide the basis for developing a better digital marketplace for local government.

**15\. Future-Proofing the Council Using AI and Machine Learning (40 mins)**

This workshop, run by Firmstep, will focus on how can councils meet the challenges of reduced funding and increased demand whilst keeping ahead of the curve using artificial intelligence and machine learning.

They will gain insight into UX best practices, pickup useful tools and tips used by top digital agencies and gain an understanding of how an authority could launch a council mobile app.

**17\. Achieving Digital Ubiquity – GDPR Compliance Through Effective Digital Design and Compelling UX (40 mins)**

Citizens expectations of user experiences are ever increasing and novel approaches to both answering queries and automating service requests will be key to meeting / exceeding expectations.

Run by IEG4 this workshop will look at a variety of design principles that can be used to answer the core trifecta of queries citizens could pose:

- tell me an answer to a question I have
- how can I do things: apply, report, book and pay
- when will something be done

We will also look at examples of integration/RPA and how this technology can provide complete automation of process and providing updates on progress to citizens via notifications.

**18\. Digital Process Design – Lessons from Holland and the UK (40 mins)**

**20\. Bristol City Council – Building digital services that can be iterated and improved in response to user need. And ensuring we have the capacity, resources and technical flexibility to do so.**

**21\. Hacking #socialcare (40 mins)**

Step away from the purely digital and joint a workshop on possibly the most pressing issue of our times. As our nation gets older and less healthy, there's more and more need for care – and less and less money to provide it. We therefore have to get creative, find resources where people only see costs, connect services, create capability – sounds like a task for #localgovcamp folk

This session will provide a really short introduction to some real, successful innovation that already exists – and some clues to potential avenues to explore. The competition will then be on to pitch an idea, identify the possibilities and what could be prototyped in the real world, present, and win by acclaim! A small but tasty prize will be provided for the winners...

Audience

Anyone who fancies the challenge of applying their creativity and innovation (tech or otherwise) to the challenges of social care in the future.

The session will be run by Benjamin Taylor, Managing Partner of RedQuadrant and chief exec of the Public Service Transformation Academy

**22\. Taking Open Data Publishing to the Next Level (40/80 mins)**

The quality of open data being published today is too low to enable effective discovery or reuse. Publishing quality open data takes too long, and is often a costly process involving a large proportion of manual, tedious processing.

We think that a combination of better tools (for e.g. cleaning data, describing it or simply better integration of the various steps of the publishing process), better methodologies, and taking advantage of automation may improve this situation.

This short workshop is aimed at airing many of these common problems and collaborating on a roadmap to solve them across the sector.

Facilitators: Lucy Knight (ODI Devon / The Data Place / Devon County Council) and Martin Howitt (ODI Devon / The Data Place / Bristol City Council)

**23\. Digital Inclusion & Accessibility (80 mins)**

Facilitated by Ben Carpenter, Inclusive Services, GDS

There are many reasons why any given user may need assisted digital support to use your digital service, no matter how brilliantly designed your online stuff is. This support is usually delivered offline. This 80 minute workshop will provide an introduction to assisted digital. The session will include group exercises, and tips and potential pitfalls to bear in mind when designing a digital service and its assisted digital support.

Audience: Anyone interested in ensuring digital services work for users who need assisted digital type support.

**24\. Getting Personal! (40 mins)**

Facilitated by Matt Culpin, Creative Director, Spacecraft Digital

How can we make a web experience more personal for each user? In this workshop, Spacecraft will guide you through ways in which assertions around known or unknown data can make it possible to make web pages personal and relevant to the user. You will learn how personalisation of web pages can make the online experience more useful; handle diverse groups of users; shorten customer journey time and aid discovery of relevant content.

**25\. The Digital Maturity Model (80 mins)**

Facilitated by FutureGov

FutureGov designs public services for the digital age. Over the last nine years FutureGov have been working with public services to support their transformation through digital and design. As part of the scoping work for the London Office of Technology and Innovation and in use with a number of County Councils, FutureGov have developed a Digital Maturity Model.

"The first stage in any digital transformation programme is to understand the digital readiness of your organisation. We've designed a Digital Maturity Assessment that helps you work through how close you are to reaching your digital ambitions. It gives you a way to move forward pragmatically by lifting the lid on a range of factors relating to digital readiness of your organisation — from technology to culture, capability to governance. " Dominic Campbell, MD FutureGov

FutureGov will host a 1.5hr session at this years Local Gov Camp to showcase brilliant examples of digital services across housing and social as well as offering the opportunity to apply the digital maturity model for your own organisation.
