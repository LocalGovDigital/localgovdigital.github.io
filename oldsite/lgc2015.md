## Fringe Events - Friday 11 September 2015

[**Local Democracy Maker Day**](https://localgov.digital/events/localgovcamp/lgc2015/makers "Local Democracy Maker Day 2015") saw LocalGov Digital's LGMakers and Local Democracy Bytes team up with [Democracy Club](https://democracyclub.org.uk/).

The day built on some of the discoveries at the successful [Not in Westminster](http://notinwestminster.org.uk) event and challenges and user needs encountered by Democracy Club from their work during General Election 2015. If you're part of local government, in an electoral, democratic or digital/web team then this event was for you. It was also open to civic coders and of course to councillors. The hashtag for the event was _#LDmaker15._

**FutureGov Leaders Summit** was an opportunity for senior officers and politicians to come together with peers to hear from big names in digital and those who were already getting it right on the ground.
