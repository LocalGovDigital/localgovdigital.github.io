### Main Unconference – Saturday 16th September 2017

Saturday was the main unconference, where the agenda was set on the day by those who attend. People from many background or interests ran sessions on things they were passionate, about and getting advice and support from some of the brightest minds in and around local government.

### Fringe Workshops – Friday 15th September 2017

This year LocalGovCamp Fringe Friday featured a workshop format, where experts from leading councils, Government Digital Service, Department for Work and Pensions, Ministry of Justice, Public Service Transformation Academy, innovation labs and more including private sector organisations ran workshops on all aspects of the Local Government Service Standard.

Sessions armed attendees with practical skills to realise each point in the Standard, from designing services around users, making the most of the agile toolkit in Local, to doing performance monitoring well and using open standards and platform components.
