title: LocalGovDigital Live!
---

LocalGovDigital Live is a series of monthly online get-togethers, where people in and around local government digital design, data and technology can get up to speed on the latest developments in the sector and hear what cool stuff other councils are up to.

It takes place on the first Tuesday of every month at 11am, runs for an hour, and is hosted on Zoom.

You can sign up to each session using the links on this page - doing so means you can easily add them to your work calendar, so you donâ€™t forget them!

The running order for each session will be:

- News and updates from LocalGovDigtial and around the sector
- A show and tell from a council, with questions and answers to follow
- Discussions within the group - sharing challenges and potential solutions

Details of what will be happening at each session will be shared on this page closer to the event!
