title: Pipeline has been retired

Pipeline was a service launched in 2014 to aid innovation and collaboration in the local government digital community.

The service was run by volunteers (thanks [Phil](http://twitter.com/philrumens) and [Ben](https://twitter.com/bforben)!) and after 10 years it was becoming increasingly challenging to maintain. The decision was taken in January 2023 to retire the service.

Thank you to everyone who contributed. People are encouraged to use the [LocalGov Digital Slack community](https://localgovdigital.slack.com) to find collaborators or share project updates.
