## Content guidance

Most information on council websites relates to a service the customer does not have to pay for at the point of delivery. The most important thing to remember when writing content relating to this is that you are not selling or promoting the service.

In many cases the customer has no choice but to use this service and because of this, the page should be kept as simple as possible, sticking to what the customer needs to know.

## Content to include
