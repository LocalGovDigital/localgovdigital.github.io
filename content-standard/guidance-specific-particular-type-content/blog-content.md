## Content guidance

Similar to promotional content, individual content is written to highlight the work or activities of one individual. Whilst this content should conform to guidance on plain English, links, etc it is possible for it to form a corporate style.

It should always be stated that the views expressed are those of the individual, and not necessarily those of the organisation that has published them.

## Content to include
