## Content guidance

For statutory reasons, sometimes councils need to publish pages written in legal or technical language. Where this is the case jargon and acronyms should be explained by the use of Tooltips and Popovers, where possible.

There should also be a companion page explaining the content in terms the public will understand, or a page with a glossary of terms, which can be linked to from the Popovers.

## Content to include
