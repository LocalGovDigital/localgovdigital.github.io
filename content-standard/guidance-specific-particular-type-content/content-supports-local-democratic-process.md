## Content guidance

This content should seek to engage with people as citizens rather than as customers. Specifically it will arise from the democratic process rather than from customer demand or service departments.

Care should be taken to provide a neutral and factual commentary of questions, proposals and decisions that come from council meetings such as cabinet and scrutiny meetings. The intention should be to provide content that will stimulate debate without entering that debate. Content should never explicitly, implicitly or by omission favour one politician or political party over another.

Each post should be about a single thing so that it can be easily shared through social media. Content should lead with something that people actually care about, in other words NOT with the details of a meeting but about the topic for that meeting. It should be written with a particular audience in mind (e.g. all residents, social workers, parents, carers). There should be a clear sense of why this group will want to engage with the content.

Content should be placed where councillors can easily see and share it and steps should be taken to encourage councillors to share this content for example by email or face to face.

## Content to include

- A title to encourage social media sharing
- A short paragraph below the title that summarises the post
- Relevant dates and locations of meetings
- Links to relevant councillors or council services
