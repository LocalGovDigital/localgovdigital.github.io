## Content guidance

Similar to promotional articles, but more functional in style this content should promptly describe the facts of the situation, linking to any relevant information.

It should describe the problem, how it might affect the reader, what the council is doing to resolve or mitigate against it, what the reader can do to resolve or mitigate against it and how the situation might change in the near future.

Unlike promotional content like news or press releases, this content should be removed as soon as the situation changes, which may be a matter of hours, as it may be viewed out of context and give readers a false representation of the situation.
